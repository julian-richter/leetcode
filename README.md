# LeetCode Practice Repository

## About This Repository

This is my private repository for solving LeetCode problems to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Purpose

While I'm currently in an apprenticeship, I've realized that I'm not getting enough exposure to algorithmic thinking and problem-solving fundamentals in my day-to-day work. This repository serves as my personal training ground to:

- **Practice problem-solving skills** through consistent LeetCode challenges
- **Learn algorithms and data structures** that aren't covered in my apprenticeship
- **Build a strong foundation** in computer science fundamentals
- **Track my progress** and learning journey over time

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode provides a structured way to practice coding problems that range from basic to advanced difficulty levels. By solving these problems regularly, I aim to:

- Improve my algorithmic thinking
- Get better at optimizing code for time and space complexity
- Learn common patterns and techniques used in software engineering
- Prepare for technical interviews and career growth

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by problem, with each folder or file containing:
- The problem description or link
- My solution(s)
- Notes on approach, complexity analysis, and learnings

## Progress

This is an ongoing learning journey. I'm committed to regular practice and continuous improvement in areas that my apprenticeship doesn't cover.
